# Introduction
  - Include literature on transcriptomic differences in digestive organs

## Sample Selection
## Hypothesis
The liver and stomach will show differentially expressed gene patterns reflecting their specialized filtering functions. The liver will express higher levels of detoxification and metabolic pathway genes; while the stomach will show elevated expression of genes related to acid production, mucus secretion, and initial digestive processes.


# Methods
## Qualitiy Analysis
## Trimming
## Mapping
## Counting
## Statistical Analysis
### Heatmap
### PCA
### Gene Heatmap
### Pathway / GO enrichment


# Results


# Discussion
